This is the first blog post attempt that I have ever made on GitHub. I am not saying anything specific, just typing for the sake of observing content and how it is presented. I think that, without hitting the enter key, this line will just go on for far two long. I need to hit the enter key
to move things into a new line. 

I need to hit enter twice in order to create a new paragraph.
