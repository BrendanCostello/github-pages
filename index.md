#: Why 100 Degrees is Too Hot
---

100<sup>degrees</sup> **Is too damn _hot_ to be outside** for the following reasons:

1. The pavement gets too hot to walk barefoot[^1]
2. Your shirt sucks up a pool of sweat[^note]
3. You are basically cooking[^3]

[^1]: My reference
[^note]: My reference for this note is also right here, but this one has two lines instead of just one, though I got the two lines by typing an execesive amount of words. The enter + two spaces trick did not work for creating a second line 
[^3]: My reference...do you get it? :+1:
